### What I learned

I learnt how to use some basic and essential CSS properties when styling a selector and took note of the effects they render on the pages.

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
main {
  margin: 0 auto;
}
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

### Continued development

i'm currently working on centralizing a component vertically and the mother-child properties.
